## 📌 About the Project

This project was developed to **[It allows us to completely secure the tokens we generate or the tokens we buy from other sites by changing their passwords quickly and securely, and as far as I examined, there was no properly working token password changer, so I made this project by developing it in a nice way.]**. It facilitates **[Users can securely change the passwords of their tokens in the form of email:password:token and get a new password and a new token. The logging system is very useful, especially for people with more tokens also if the application closes due to a problem, it can resume where it left off.]**.
